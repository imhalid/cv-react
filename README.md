# cv-react

Another challenge I made myself. I learned many things again, the most important of which is that the measurements are not always correct when working with Figma!! :D

i found out that i need to post my files to github via vscode instead of terminal.
(it took me about 15 minutes and almost all my work was lost `(@.@)` )

# Substances

- Using svg and adding `:hover` property. 
- `:hover` property does not work in svg if `<path>` has `fill`
- I learned how to create and use Components with React. it's definitely easy.
